This repos contain the first completed assignment for Exploratory Data Analysis Coursera Course. In addition to this readme, There
are 9 different files:

plot1.R</li>
plot1.png</li>
plot2.R</li>
plot2.png</li>
plot3.R</li>
plot3.png</li>
plot4.R</li>
plot4.png</li>
household_power_consumption.txt</li>

The R files contains the code used to produce the plots in the png files. Below is a description of each plot:

plot1: histogram of Global Active Power</li>
plot2: scatterplot of Date and Global Active Power</li>
plot3: Scatterplot of Date and each of the Energy Sub Meterings</li>
plot4: plot1, scatterplot of Date and Voltage, plot3, and scatterplot of Date and Global Reactive Power displayed together</li>

At the bottom of this file, is the original description of the data used for this assignment (household_power_consumption.txt)
given in the assignment description. The data in the plots represent data from two days in February 2007.

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>
